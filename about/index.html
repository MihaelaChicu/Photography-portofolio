            <p>
                 I'm a Romanian photographer from Bucharest, Romania.
                 <br>
                 Taking photos since 2022, my main subjects are cats, people and scenary. 
                 <br>
                 Love a good bright color combination to make the world a little warmer.
                 <br>
                 I love dark humour and kind people, hope to be among the good ones.
                 <br>
                 Here to help out with my photography, hit me up if you enjoy my work.
            </p>
